### Image Search Application 
Is a Weekend Project for learning MVVM architecture for Android Application.
As a list of technologies I am going to use below given Android Components for this project

1. Navigation Host
2. Paging 3
3. ViewModel
4. LiveData
5. Retrofit 
6. Coroutines
7. Dagger Hilt

I am going to use Only Network Api calling for repository for this app, as main focus for this app 
is fetching internet data using paging and live data.
